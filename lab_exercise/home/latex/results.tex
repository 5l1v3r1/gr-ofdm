\section{Task 2}
This exercise is implicitly related to the analytical results obtained in the preparatory exercises. In order to achieve particular BER, each modulation requires a certain SNR value which defines the rate-power function for a given system. BER values of~$10^{-2}$ and~$10^{-3}$ are investigated.

\section{Task 3}
The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate the bandwidth efficiency of OFDM systems in frequency selective channels. The experiment is based on system simulation since the real channel environment for the given transmission bandwidth does not experience multipath propagation. Firstly, the OFDM system where \textbf{all} subcarriers are loaded with BPSK symbols is simulated. The required BER is reached by fitting the transmit amplitude. Then, using the same transmit amplitude, the OFDM system is simulated using the \textbf{better half} of the subcarriers loaded with QPSK symbols, thus preserving the same data rate and halving the bandwidth usage. This usage of subcarriers per modulation scheme is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:FSC}.

\section{Task 5}
This exercise investigates the influence of frequency offset on system performance. Without loss of generality, the experiment is conducted only for QPSK modulation scheme and performance is depicted jointly with analytical results.
